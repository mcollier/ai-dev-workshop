# GitHub Copilot Instructions for .NET Workshop

> These instructions are automatically applied to all GitHub Copilot suggestions when working with C# files.

## 0) Workshop Mode
- Assume **.NET 10**, **xUnit**, **FakeItEasy**, **Minimal API**, **ILogger**, **async/await** everywhere.
- Prefer **Clean Architecture** solution layout and **DDD** patterns.
- Always generate examples and code in **English**.

---

## 1) Workflow (TDD + Build Hygiene)
- **TDD first**: when asked to implement a feature, propose/emit tests before code.
- After you output code, assume we run `dotnet build && dotnet test` and fix warnings/errors before committing.
- When referencing rule sets, state what you followed (e.g., "Used: Clean Architecture, DDD, Tests").

---

## 2) Solution & Project Architecture (Clean Architecture)
Generate and maintain the following structure:  
`[project].Domain`, `[project].Application`, `[project].Infrastructure`, `[project].Api`, plus `tests/[project].UnitTests` and `tests/[project].IntegrationTests`. Enforce dependencies:  
- **Domain** → no deps  
- **Application** → Domain only  
- **Infrastructure** → Application + Domain  
- **Api** → Infrastructure only  
Prefer **feature-oriented folders** (e.g., `Order/`, `Customer/`) instead of technical groupings.

Implementation guidance:
- **Domain**: business logic, entities, value objects, domain events. No external deps.  
- **Application**: use cases, commands/queries, ports (interfaces).  
- **Infrastructure**: adapters, EF/database, external integrations.  
- **Api**: minimal endpoints + request/response mapping only.  
- Use DI; avoid circular deps; no mediator library for this workshop.

---


## 3) C# Coding Style (C#/.NET conventions)
- File-scoped namespaces; one type per file; 4-space indent; `PascalCase` for types/members, `camelCase` for locals/parameters; constants ALL_CAPS.  
- Prefer clarity over brevity; use `nameof` in exceptions; **make classes `sealed` by default** unless inheritance is intentional.

See [csharp.instructions.md](csharp.instructions.md) for full C#/.NET coding standards and best practices.

---

## 4) DDD Modeling Rules
- Model **Aggregates** with factory methods (no public constructors), encapsulate invariants, and avoid direct navigation to other aggregates.  
- **Entities** live inside aggregates; no public setters; lifecycle managed by the root.  
- **Value Objects** are immutable; implement value equality.  
- Prefer **Strongly-Typed IDs** (e.g., `OrderId`) as value objects.  
- **Repositories** are interfaces for aggregate roots with **business-intent method names** (no generic CRUD verbs in domain).

**Method naming**: favor ubiquitous language (e.g., `PlaceOrder`, `MarkAsShipped`) over `Create/Update/Delete/Get`.

---

## 5) Testing Rules
- **Test framework**: `xunit.v3`.  
- **Mocks**: `FakeItEasy`.  
- **Integration**: `Testcontainers` (and `Microcks` if doing contract tests).  
- Unit tests target **Domain** + **Application** only; Integration tests target **Infrastructure** + **Api**.  
- Organize tests by **feature** and, for complex types, by **class-per-method** folders.  
- Keep tests descriptive; run tests frequently (`dotnet test` / `dotnet watch`).

---

## 6) Committing Changes
- When asked to commit changes, just commit — commit message format
  (Conventional Commits) is handled by the `git-commit` skill
  (`.github/skills/git-commit/SKILL.md`), loaded on demand instead of kept
  in every prompt's context.

---

## 7) Object Calisthenics (lightweight)
When refactoring, prefer these constraints to keep code small and intention-revealing:
- One level of indentation per method; avoid `else` with guard clauses ("fail fast").  
- Wrap primitives into meaningful types; prefer **first-class collections**.  
- Avoid long call chains ("one dot per line" guideline).  
- Don't abbreviate names; keep classes/methods small and focused.  
- Limit domain classes' setters; prefer factories and invariants.

---

## 8) Documentation Organization
- **All documentation** must be placed in the `docs/` directory at repository root
- Project README.md stays at root, but detailed docs go in `docs/`
- Documentation types and locations:
  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): `docs/adr/`
  - API documentation: `docs/api/`
  - User guides and tutorials: `docs/guides/`
  - Design documents: `docs/design/`
  - Lab exercises and workshop materials: `docs/labs/` or `docs/`
- Use clear, descriptive filenames: `docs/api/authentication-guide.md` not `docs/auth.md`
- Always link to docs from main README.md with relative paths
- When generating documentation, ask: "Should this go in docs/ or is it the main README?"

---

## 9) Practical Scaffolds & Prompts (use verbatim)

### 9.1 Generate a new Aggregate (Domain)
```text
Create a DDD aggregate in [project].Domain/Order:
- Strongly-typed IDs (OrderId, CustomerId)
- Private ctor + static factory Order.Create(...)
- Invariants: quantity > 0, price > 0
- Value object Address { Street, City, Country } as immutable record
- Business methods: RegisterOrderItem, ChangeShippingAddress (raise domain event)
- No navigation to other aggregates; no public setters
```

### 9.2 Minimal API endpoint (Api) + DI wiring
```text
In [project].Api (Minimal API):
- Add endpoints: GET /orders/{id}, POST /orders
- Map requests to Application commands/queries; no business logic in Api
- Register DI for repositories/services in Infrastructure
- Use ILogger, async/await, proper 400/404/500 handling with ProblemDetails
```

### 9.3 Unit test pattern (xUnit + FakeItEasy)
```text
Create tests in tests/[project].UnitTests/OrdersTests/:
- One test class per method (CreateTests.cs, RegisterOrderItemTests.cs)
- Use FakeItEasy for collaborator interfaces
- Use descriptive test names and cover invalid scenarios (guard clauses)
```

### 9.4 Commit helper
```text
Commit the staged changes.
```
The `git-commit` skill produces the Conventional Commit message based on the staged diff.

---

## 10) Guardrails (Workshop)
- Do **not** invent external dependencies without being asked.  
- Keep domain logic **out of Api/Infrastructure**.  
- Prefer small, composable methods; log meaningfully with `ILogger<T>`.  
- If a rule conflicts, **Clean Architecture boundaries win** (then DDD, then Style).

---

### Appendix A — Expected Layout (example)
```text
src/
  Sales.Domain/
  Sales.Application/
  Sales.Infrastructure/
  Sales.Api/
tests/
  Sales.UnitTests/
  Sales.IntegrationTests/
```

---

### Appendix B — OpenTelemetry Observability
- Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing in API layer
- Configure ActivitySource for custom spans in Application layer
- Add meaningful tags to activities (e.g., task ID, operation type)
- Use console exporter for workshop demos (no complex infrastructure needed)
