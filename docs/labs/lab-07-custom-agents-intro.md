# Lab 07: Introduction to Custom Copilot Agents

**Module:** 2  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Part:** Advanced GitHub Copilot (Part 2)

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand what Custom Copilot Agents are and how they work
- Differentiate between agents, prompts, and Copilot Instructions
- Use a pre-built custom agent in Agent Mode
- Recognize when custom agents improve consistency over ad-hoc prompting

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [Lab 05: Interaction Models](lab-05-interaction-models.md)
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- Access to the TaskManager workshop repository

## Background

### What Are Custom Copilot Agents?

Custom Copilot Agents are **specialized AI assistants** that provide consistent, role-based guidance for specific workflows. Think of them as expert consultants you can invoke when needed.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Named entities** - Selectable from the agent dropdown
- **Role-based personas** - Architecture reviewer, test strategist, backlog generator, etc.
- **Defined scope** - Clear responsibilities and constraints
- **Structured outputs** - Consistent format for results
- **Team-aligned** - Encode team practices and standards

### Mental Model: The Specialist Analogy

```
Standard Copilot Chat = General AI Assistant
Custom Agent = Domain Expert Consultant

You wouldn't ask a general assistant to:
- Review architecture (you'd ask an architect)
- Plan testing strategy (you'd ask a QA specialist)
- Generate backlog items (you'd ask a product analyst)

Custom agents ARE those specialists.
```

### How Agents Differ From...

| Feature | Copilot Instructions | Ad-hoc Prompts | Custom Agents |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | Always active | One-off | Invoked on demand |
| **Purpose** | Global guardrails | Specific task | Repeatable workflow |
| **Reusability** | Implicit | Manual copy/paste | Built-in |
| **Consistency** | Background rules | Variable | Structured |
| **Best for** | Coding standards | Exploration | Workflow automation |

### When to Use Custom Agents

✅ **Use agents when:**
- You have **repeated workflows** (reviews, planning, analysis)
- You need **consistent outputs** across team members
- You want to **encode expert knowledge** in a reusable form
- You're performing **validation or review** tasks

❌ **Don't use agents when:**
- A simple prompt suffices
- You're exploring or learning
- The task is one-off or unique

## Exercise 1: Using the Architecture Reviewer Agent (15 minutes)

### Setup

The repository includes a pre-built **Architecture Reviewer** agent at `.github/agents/architecture-reviewer.agent.md`.

### Scenario

You suspect there might be architectural issues in the Task entity or the repository implementation. You want an expert review.

### Instructions

1. **Locate the agent:**
   - Navigate to `.github/agents/architecture-reviewer.agent.md`
   - Read the agent's responsibilities and constraints
   - Note the structured output format

2. **Open Copilot Chat** and switch to **Agent Mode**

3. **Select the Architecture Reviewer agent** from the dropdown

4. **Use this prompt:**
   ```
   Review the Task entity and TaskRepository for architectural compliance with Clean Architecture and DDD patterns.
   ```

5. **Observe the agent's behavior:**
   - Does it follow its defined structure?
   - Does it reference the layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Api)?
   - Does it provide the expected sections (Strengths, Concerns, Violations, Recommendations)?

6. **Compare to standard Copilot Chat:**
   - Try the same prompt in regular Chat (without the agent)
   - Note the differences in depth, structure, and consistency

### Expected Outcome

The Architecture Reviewer agent should:
- Analyze the code through a Clean Architecture lens
- Identify specific boundary violations (if any)
- Provide structured findings (✅ Strengths, ⚠️ Concerns, 🚫 Violations)
- Give actionable recommendations
- Reference project conventions (ADRs, DDD patterns)

### Reflection Questions

1. **How did the agent's response differ from standard Chat?**
2. **Did the agent follow its defined output format?**
3. **Would this consistency be valuable for team code reviews?**
4. **What happens if you ask the agent something outside its scope?**

---

## Exercise 2: Compare Agent vs. Standard Chat (10 minutes)

### Instructions

Perform the same task twice:

#### Round 1: Standard Copilot Chat
1. Open Copilot Chat (no agent selected)
2. Prompt: `Review the Task domain model for DDD compliance`
3. Record the response structure and depth

#### Round 2: Architecture Reviewer Agent
1. Switch to Agent Mode
2. Select **Architecture Reviewer** from dropdown
3. Same prompt: `Review the Task domain model for DDD compliance`
4. Record the response structure and depth

### Comparison Table

Fill in based on your observations:

| Aspect | Standard Chat | Architecture Reviewer Agent |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|
| **Response Format** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Depth of Analysis** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Consistency** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Actionability** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Repeatability** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |

## Exercise 3: Exploring Other Agents (5 minutes)

The repository includes three custom agents. Briefly explore each:

### 1. Backlog Generator
- **Location:** `.github/agents/backlog-generator.agent.md`
- **Try:** "Generate user stories for adding task comments feature"
- **Observe:** Structured user stories with acceptance criteria

### 2. Test Strategist
- **Location:** `.github/agents/test-strategist.agent.md`
- **Try:** "Propose test scenarios for Task creation"
- **Observe:** Categorized test scenarios (unit, integration, edge cases)

### Questions

- Which agent would you use most frequently in your work?
- Can you think of other agents your team might need?

## Key Insights

### If Copilot Instructions Are Guardrails...

**Copilot Instructions** = Background rules always enforced  
(e.g., "Use Clean Architecture, write tests first, follow DDD")

**Custom Agents** = Specialists you consult on demand  
(e.g., "Architecture Reviewer, analyze this design")

### Agents Are Products, Not Prompts

- Agents should be **versioned and reviewed** (like code)
- Agents **encode team knowledge** and standards
- Agents provide **repeatable, consistent outcomes**
- Agents improve **onboarding** (new team members use the same expert guidance)

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Custom agents provide role-based expertise** on demand  
✅ **Agents ensure consistency** across team members  
✅ **Agents are reusable** - define once, use repeatedly  
✅ **Agents complement Instructions** - not a replacement  
⚠️ **Agents require maintenance** - treat them as team assets

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use multiple agents in one session?**  
A: Yes! Switch agents as needed for different workflow steps.

**Q: Do agents replace Copilot Instructions?**  
A: No. Instructions are always-on guardrails; agents are on-demand specialists.

**Q: Can I create my own agent?**  
A: Absolutely! That's covered in [Lab 09: Agent Design](lab-09-agent-design.md) and [Lab 10: Build Your Own](lab-10-capstone-build-agent.md).

**Q: What if an agent gives incorrect advice?**  
A: Agents are assistants, not authorities. You're accountable for the final decision. Iterate on agent instructions to improve accuracy.

## Next Steps

In [Lab 08: Workflow Agents in Action](lab-08-workflow-agents.md), you'll apply these agents to real development workflows and compare their outputs to ad-hoc prompting.
