# Lab 08: Workflow Agents in Action

**Module:** 3  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Part:** Advanced GitHub Copilot (Part 2)

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Apply custom agents to real development workflows
- Compare agent outputs to standard Copilot Chat responses
- Evaluate reliability and consistency differences
- Understand when agents provide meaningful value over ad-hoc prompting

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [Lab 07: Custom Agents Intro](lab-07-custom-agents-intro.md)
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- Access to the TaskManager workshop repository
- Familiarity with the three custom agents (Architecture Reviewer, Backlog Generator, Test Strategist)

## Lab Structure

You'll work through **3 workflow scenarios**, each testing a different agent. For each scenario, you'll:

1. **First:** Use standard Copilot Chat (no agent)
2. **Second:** Use the appropriate custom agent
3. **Compare:** Document differences in quality, structure, and consistency

---

## Scenario 1: Backlog Generation (15 minutes)

### Context

Your team wants to add a **notification system** to the TaskManager application. Users should receive notifications when:
- A task is assigned to them
- A task deadline is approaching
- A task status changes

You need to break this down into user stories with acceptance criteria.

---

### Part A: Standard Copilot Chat

**Instructions:**

1. Open Copilot Chat (no agent selected)
2. Use this prompt:

```
Create user stories for a notification system in the TaskManager app.
Users should get notifications when tasks are assigned, deadlines approach, or status changes.
Include acceptance criteria.
```

3. **Record the output** (copy/paste into a document or note the structure)

**Questions to consider:**
- How are the stories formatted?
- Are acceptance criteria specific and testable?
- Is the output consistent with agile best practices?

---

### Part B: Backlog Generator Agent

**Instructions:**

1. Switch to **Agent Mode**
2. Select **Backlog Generator** from the agent dropdown
3. Use the same (or similar) prompt:

```
Create user stories for a notification system in the TaskManager app.
Users should get notifications when tasks are assigned, deadlines approach, or status changes.
```

4. **Record the output**

**Expected agent behavior:**
- User stories in "As a... I want... So that..." format
- Specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Story points or sizing estimates
- Dependencies identified
- INVEST principles applied

---

## Scenario 2: Architecture Review (15 minutes)

### Context

A team member has submitted a pull request that adds a new `NotificationService` in the **Application** layer. You want to ensure it follows Clean Architecture and DDD patterns before approving.

---

### Setup

Create a sample file to review (or use an existing Application service):

**File:** `src/TaskManager.Application/Services/NotificationService.cs`

```csharp
namespace TaskManager.Application.Services;

public class NotificationService
{
    private readonly ITaskRepository _taskRepository;
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

    public NotificationService(ITaskRepository taskRepository, IEmailService emailService)
    {
        _taskRepository = taskRepository;
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public async Task NotifyTaskAssignedAsync(int taskId, string assigneeEmail)
    {
        var task = await _taskRepository.GetByIdAsync(taskId);
        if (task != null)
        {
            await _emailService.SendAsync(assigneeEmail, "Task Assigned", $"You have been assigned task: {task.Title}");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Part A: Standard Copilot Chat

**Instructions:**

1. Open Copilot Chat (no agent)
2. Open the `NotificationService.cs` file
3. Prompt:

```
Review this NotificationService for Clean Architecture compliance and suggest improvements.
```

4. **Record the feedback**

---

### Part B: Architecture Reviewer Agent

**Instructions:**

1. Switch to **Agent Mode**
2. Select **Architecture Reviewer** from dropdown
3. Same prompt:

```
Review this NotificationService for Clean Architecture compliance and suggest improvements.
```

4. **Record the feedback**

**Expected agent behavior:**
- Structured review (Strengths, Concerns, Violations, Recommendations)
- Layer-specific analysis (Application layer rules)
- DDD pattern evaluation
- Dependency direction checks
- Specific, actionable recommendations

---

### Comparison Questions

| Aspect | Standard Chat | Architecture Reviewer Agent |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|
| **Review Structure** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Depth of Analysis** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Actionable Recommendations** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Consistency with Standards** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Ready to Use in PR Review?** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |

**Reflection:**
- Did the agent identify issues standard chat missed?
- Is the agent's format more useful for code review comments?
- Would you trust this agent's review as a first pass?

---

## Scenario 3: Test Strategy (15 minutes)

### Context

You're implementing a new feature: **Task Assignment**. A task can be assigned to a user, and the assignment should:
- Validate that the user exists
- Validate that the task exists
- Record assignment timestamp
- Emit a domain event (`TaskAssigned`)

You need a test strategy.

---

### Part A: Standard Copilot Chat

**Instructions:**

1. Open Copilot Chat (no agent)
2. Prompt:

```
Propose test scenarios for a task assignment feature.
Validate user and task exist, record timestamp, emit domain event.
```

3. **Record the test scenarios**

---

### Part B: Test Strategist Agent

**Instructions:**

1. Switch to **Agent Mode**
2. Select **Test Strategist** from dropdown
3. Same prompt:

```
Propose test scenarios for a task assignment feature.
Validate user and task exist, record timestamp, emit domain event.
```

4. **Record the test scenarios**

**Expected agent behavior:**
- Categorized tests (unit, integration, edge cases)
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) descriptions
- Specific test names
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error handling scenarios
- Testability recommendations

---

### Comparison Questions

| Aspect | Standard Chat | Test Strategist Agent |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Test Organization** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Coverage Completeness** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Edge Case Identification** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Test Naming Clarity** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |
| **Ready to Implement?** | [Your observation] | [Your observation] |

**Reflection:**
- Did the agent identify edge cases you hadn't considered?
- Is the agent's categorization helpful?
- Would you feel confident implementing tests from the agent's output?

---

## Group Discussion (If in Workshop Setting)

**Share your findings:**

1. **Which agent provided the most value?**
2. **Did agents catch issues that standard chat missed?**
3. **Were the structured outputs more useful than free-form responses?**
4. **What are the limitations of agents?**

---

## Key Takeaways

### Agents Excel At:
✅ **Structured, repeatable workflows** (reviews, planning, analysis)  
✅ **Consistency across team members** (same agent = same format)  
✅ **Encoding domain expertise** (architecture, testing, product practices)  
✅ **First-pass automation** (reduce manual work)

### Agents Are Not:
❌ **Always correct** - You're still accountable  
❌ **Replacements for human judgment** - They're assistants  
❌ **One-size-fits-all** - Use the right agent for the job

### When Agents Shine:
- **Code reviews** (automated first pass)
- **Backlog grooming** (consistent story format)
- **Test planning** (comprehensive coverage)
- **Documentation generation** (structured outputs)
- **Knowledge transfer** (encode team practices)

---

## Challenge Exercise (Optional)

**Try this:**

Create a **custom scenario** for your own work:
1. Identify a repetitive workflow in your daily work
2. Use standard Chat to perform it
3. Then use the most relevant agent (or imagine what agent you'd need)
4. Compare the results

**Bonus:** Draft an agent definition for a workflow you need. (You'll formalize this in Labs 08-09.)

## Next Steps

In [Lab 09: Agent Design](lab-09-agent-design.md), you'll learn **how to design effective agents** — instruction components, iteration loops, and governance.
