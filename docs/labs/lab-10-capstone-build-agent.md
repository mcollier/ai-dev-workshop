# Lab 10: Capstone - Build a Production-Ready Agent

**Module:** 5  
**Duration:** 35 minutes  
**Part:** Advanced GitHub Copilot / Claude Code (Part 2)

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Create a functional custom agent from scratch
- Apply all design principles learned in previous labs
- Test and iterate on agent behavior
- Prepare an agent for team use with clear documentation

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [Lab 09: Agent Design](lab-09-agent-design.md)
- VS Code with the GitHub Copilot extension, and/or Claude Code installed
- Access to the TaskManager workshop repository (.NET)
- Understanding of agent components and design patterns
- Familiarity with .NET and C#

> **Note**: Most of the lab is technology-agnostic, focusing on agent design principles. Where stack-specific context is helpful, examples use .NET. You'll build a single agent definition and adapt it for whichever tool(s) you use — the seven-component model from Lab 09 is shared across both.

## Overview

In this capstone lab, you'll **build your own custom agent** aligned to a real workflow. You'll define success criteria, create the agent definition, test it, iterate, and prepare it for team use.

---

## Step 1: Select Your Agent Role (5 minutes)

Choose **one** of these agent roles (or propose your own):

### Option A: Code Reviewer
**Role:** Reviews code for quality, standards, and best practices  
**Workflow:** Pull request reviews, pre-commit checks  
**Value:** Consistent code quality across team members

**Example Focus Areas:**
- Sealed classes, async/await patterns, ILogger usage, guard clauses

### Option B: Documentation Writer
**Role:** Generates or reviews documentation for clarity and completeness  
**Workflow:** API docs, README updates, architectural decision records  
**Value:** Consistent documentation standards

### Option C: Performance Auditor
**Role:** Identifies performance issues and optimization opportunities  
**Workflow:** Reviewing slow endpoints, database queries, algorithms  
**Value:** Proactive performance monitoring

**Example Focus Areas:**
- EF Core query optimization, async/await overhead, collection allocations

### Option D: Security Reviewer
**Role:** Reviews code for security vulnerabilities and best practices  
**Workflow:** Pre-deployment security checks, sensitive data handling  
**Value:** Reduced security risks

**Example Focus Areas:**
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication/authorization patterns

### Option E: Your Custom Agent
**Role:** [Define your own based on team needs]  
**Workflow:** [Describe the workflow]  
**Value:** [What problem does it solve?]

### Decision

**I will create:** [Agent name and role]

---

## Step 2: Define Success Criteria (5 minutes)

Before writing instructions, define what "good" looks like for your agent.

### Success Criteria Template

**My agent is successful when:**
1. [Criterion 1 - e.g., "It identifies all security vulnerabilities in sample code"]
2. [Criterion 2 - e.g., "It provides actionable remediation steps"]
3. [Criterion 3 - e.g., "It doesn't flag false positives for safe patterns"]
4. [Criterion 4 - e.g., "Output is structured and consistent"]
5. [Criterion 5 - e.g., "It can be used by any team member with the same results"]

### Test Scenarios

**I will test my agent with:**
1. [Test scenario 1 - e.g., "Code with SQL injection vulnerability"]
2. [Test scenario 2 - e.g., "Code with proper input validation"]
3. [Test scenario 3 - e.g., "Edge case or boundary condition"]

---

## Step 3: Create the Agent Definition (15 minutes)

Choose your file location and frontmatter based on the tool(s) you're targeting:

| <img src="../images/githubcopilot.svg" width="20" alt="GitHub Copilot" /> GitHub Copilot                           | <img src="../images/claude-color.svg" width="20" alt="Claude Code" /> Claude Code                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create `.github/agents/[your-agent-name].agent.md`                                                                 | Create `.claude/agents/[your-agent-name].md`                                                                 |
| `tools:` is an array (e.g. `['read', 'search']`)                                                                   | `tools:` is a comma-separated list (e.g. `Read, Grep, Glob`)                                                 |
| Optionally add `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`, `agents`, `argument-hint`, or `handoffs` (see Lab 09) | These advanced properties aren't supported — keep the frontmatter to `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model` |

The body — Identity, Responsibilities, Context, Constraints, Process, Output
Format, Tone — is identical either way. If you're targeting both tools,
write the body once and copy it into both files, adjusting only the
frontmatter.

Use this template and customize for your agent:

```markdown
---
name: "[agent-name]"
description: '[Brief description of what this agent does]'
tools: [changes]  # Copilot: array, e.g. ['read', 'search']. Claude Code: comma list, e.g. Read, Grep
model: Claude Sonnet 4
---

# [Agent Name]

You are an expert [role/specialty] with deep knowledge of [domain expertise].

## Responsibilities

- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]
- [Responsibility 4]

## Context

This project follows [relevant context about the codebase, standards, patterns]:
- [Context point 1]
- [Context point 2]
- [Context point 3]

**Include relevant context, for example:**
- Clean Architecture, CQRS pattern, sealed classes, async/await, ILogger, xUnit + FakeItEasy

## Constraints

- ALWAYS [critical rule the agent must follow]
- NEVER [something the agent must avoid]
- [Additional constraint]
- [Additional constraint]

## Analysis Process

1. [Step 1 of how the agent should approach the task]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
4. [Step 4]

## Output Format

Provide your [review/analysis/report] in this structured format:

### [Section 1 Title]
- **[Field]:** [description]
- **[Field]:** [description]

### [Section 2 Title]

[Description of what goes in this section]

### [Section 3 Title]

[Description of what goes in this section]

## Tone

- [Tone guideline 1 - e.g., "Be direct and constructive"]
- [Tone guideline 2 - e.g., "Explain WHY, not just WHAT"]
- [Tone guideline 3 - e.g., "Acknowledge good practices"]

## Examples of What to Flag

**Adjust based on your agent role. Here are examples for a Code Reviewer:**

### Examples
- Missing `sealed` keyword on classes that shouldn't be inherited
- Synchronous I/O in async methods (blocking calls)
- Missing guard clauses or using nested `if` statements instead
- String interpolation in logging statements (should use structured logging)
- Not using `nameof()` operator in exceptions
- Missing `CancellationToken` parameters in async methods
```

For reference, the workshop's own `.claude/agents/architecture-reviewer.md`,
`backlog-generator.md`, and `test-strategist.md` follow this same structure —
review them before writing your own.

### Instructions

1. Create the file (`.github/agents/[your-agent-name].agent.md` and/or `.claude/agents/[your-agent-name].md`)
2. Fill in all sections based on your chosen role
3. Be specific in constraints and output format
4. Include examples where helpful

---

## Step 4: Test Your Agent (10 minutes)

### Test Procedure

| <img src="../images/githubcopilot.svg" width="20" alt="GitHub Copilot" /> GitHub Copilot | <img src="../images/claude-color.svg" width="20" alt="Claude Code" /> Claude Code                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Open Copilot Chat in Agent Mode<br>2. Select your custom agent from the dropdown      | 1. Open the Claude Code REPL<br>2. Mention `@[your-agent-name]`, or let Claude auto-delegate based on the `description` |

1. **Run each test scenario** you defined in Step 2
2. **Record the results:**
   - Did the agent follow the output format?
   - Did it meet your success criteria?
   - Were there unexpected behaviors?
   - What worked well? What didn't?

### Example Test Scenarios

**For Code Reviewer Agent:**

#### Test Scenario
```csharp
// Test file with intentional issues
public class TaskService  // Missing 'sealed'
{
    public async Task<Task> GetTaskAsync(Guid id)  // Missing CancellationToken
    {
        if (id == Guid.Empty)
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid ID");  // Missing nameof()
        
        var result = _repository.GetAsync(id).Result;  // Blocking in async!
        _logger.LogInformation($"Found task {id}");  // String interpolation in logging
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Test Results Template

**Test 1:** [Scenario description]  
- **Agent Output:** [Summary or excerpt]  
- **Success Criteria Met:** [Yes/No - which ones?]  
- **Issues Found:** [List any problems]

**Test 2:** [Scenario description]  
- **Agent Output:** [Summary or excerpt]  
- **Success Criteria Met:** [Yes/No - which ones?]  
- **Issues Found:** [List any problems]

**Test 3:** [Scenario description]  
- **Agent Output:** [Summary or excerpt]  
- **Success Criteria Met:** [Yes/No - which ones?]  
- **Issues Found:** [List any problems]

---

## Step 5: Iterate and Refine (5 minutes)

Based on your test results, refine your agent:

### Common Issues and Fixes

| Issue                      | Likely Cause                  | Fix                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Output format inconsistent | Vague instructions            | Add explicit structure with headings |
| Agent goes out of scope    | No constraints                | Add "NEVER" constraints              |
| Too verbose                | No guidance on brevity        | Add tone guidance: "Be concise"      |
| Misses important checks    | Missing from responsibilities | Add to responsibilities list         |
| False positives            | Overly broad rules            | Add examples of acceptable patterns  |

### Refinement Process

1. Identify the top 2-3 issues from testing
2. Update your agent's instructions (in `.github/agents/` and/or `.claude/agents/`)
3. **Re-test** with the same scenarios
4. Repeat until success criteria are met

---

## Step 6: Document Your Agent (5 minutes)

Create a brief usage guide for your agent:

### Agent Documentation Template

**Agent Name:** [Your agent name]

**Available In:** [ ] GitHub Copilot (`.github/agents/`)  [ ] Claude Code (`.claude/agents/`)

**Purpose:** [One-sentence description]

**When to Use:**
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]
- [Use case 3]

**When NOT to Use:**
- [Anti-pattern 1]
- [Anti-pattern 2]

**Example Prompts:**
```text
[Example prompt 1]
[Example prompt 2]
[Example prompt 3]
```

**Expected Output:**
- [What users should expect]
- [Output structure/format]

**Limitations:**
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

**Maintenance:**
- **Owner:** [Your name or team]
- **Last Updated:** [Date]
- **Review Frequency:** [e.g., Quarterly]

---

## Deliverables

At the end of this lab, you should have:

✅ A custom agent definition file (`.github/agents/[name].agent.md` and/or `.claude/agents/[name].md`)  
✅ Test results showing the agent meets success criteria  
✅ Usage documentation for team members  
✅ At least one iteration/refinement based on testing

---

## Group Share (If in Workshop Setting)

**Demonstrate your agent:**
1. Show the agent name, purpose, and which tool(s) it targets
2. Run a live demo with a test scenario
3. Show the structured output
4. Share one key design decision you made
5. Share one challenge you encountered

**Learn from others:**
- What agents did others create?
- What patterns emerged across different agents?
- What would you borrow for your next agent?

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Start with success criteria** - Define "done" before building  
✅ **Test early and often** - Don't wait until it's "perfect"  
✅ **Iterate based on real usage** - Agents improve over time  
✅ **Document for others** - Agents are team assets, not personal tools  
✅ **Keep scope focused** - Better to excel at one thing than be mediocre at many  
✅ **Author once, adapt twice** - The seven-component model transfers directly between Copilot `.agent.md` files and Claude Code `.claude/agents/*.md` subagents

---

## Next Steps: Taking Agents to Production

### Before sharing your agent with the team

1. **Test with real scenarios** (not just examples)
2. **Get peer review** (have a colleague test it)
3. **Document edge cases** and limitations
4. **Add to the team catalog** ([docs/guides/custom-agent-catalog.md](../guides/custom-agent-catalog.md))
5. **Set up governance** (review process, versioning)
6. **Decide which tool(s) to maintain it for** — a single team may standardize on Copilot, Claude Code, or keep both in sync

### Continuous Improvement

- Collect feedback from team usage
- Track common issues or misunderstandings
- Update instructions based on lessons learned
- Retire or merge agents that become obsolete

---

## Bonus Challenge (Optional)

**Advanced Exercise:**

Create a **second agent** that complements your first one. For example:
- If you built a Security Reviewer, build a Security Remediation Guide
- If you built a Documentation Writer, build a Documentation Reviewer
- If you built a Performance Auditor, build a Performance Optimizer

**Workflow:** Use both agents in sequence to demonstrate a complete workflow.

---

## Workshop Conclusion (Module 6)

Congratulations! You've completed the Advanced GitHub Copilot / Claude Code workshop.

### What You've Learned

- ✅ Ask, Plan, and Agent interaction models
- ✅ When and how to use custom agents
- ✅ How to design reliable, role-based agents
- ✅ Iteration and governance for agent maintenance
- ✅ Hands-on experience building a production-ready agent for one or both tools

### Putting It Into Practice

**Week 1:** Use existing agents (Architecture Reviewer, Backlog Generator, Test Strategist) in your daily work  
**Week 2:** Identify one repetitive workflow and draft an agent for it  
**Week 3:** Test and refine your agent with real scenarios  
**Week 4:** Share with your team and gather feedback

### Final Reflection

1. **Which workflows will benefit most from agents in your work?**
2. **What agents should be standardized across your team?**
3. **How will you prevent "prompt sprawl" as agents proliferate?**
4. **Who will own agent governance on your team?**
5. **Will your team standardize on one AI coding tool, or maintain agents for both?**
