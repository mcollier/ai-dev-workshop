# Agent Test Scenario: Backlog Generator

This document contains test scenarios for validating the Backlog Generator agent.

## Scenario 1: Basic Feature Request

### Input

**Prompt:**
```
Generate user stories for a task notification system. Users should receive 
notifications when tasks are assigned to them and when tasks are approaching 
their due dates.
```

**Context:** No additional files or context provided.

### Expected Output

**Format:**
- Multiple user stories following "As a... I want... So that..." format
- Each story should have acceptance criteria
- Stories should be independent (INVEST principles)
- Should include estimates and priorities
- Should identify dependencies if any

**Content Expectations:**
- At least 3-4 user stories
- Stories cover: task assignment notifications, due date notifications
- May include: notification preferences, notification delivery methods
- Acceptance criteria are testable
- Estimates are reasonable (e.g., 1-5 story points)

**Example Expected Story:**
```markdown
### Story 1: Receive Notification on Task Assignment

**As a** team member
**I want** to receive a notification when a task is assigned to me
**So that** I can be immediately aware of new responsibilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given a task is assigned to me, When the assignment is saved, 
      Then I receive a notification within 1 minute
- [ ] Given I receive a notification, When I click it, 
      Then I am taken to the task details page
- [ ] Given multiple tasks are assigned, When they are assigned in bulk, 
      Then I receive a single summary notification

**Dependencies:** None
**Estimate:** 3 points
**Priority:** High
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Output follows defined format
- [ ] All stories use "As a... I want... So that..." structure
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear and testable
- [ ] Stories are appropriately sized
- [ ] Priorities make sense
- [ ] No duplicate functionality across stories

## Scenario 2: Epic Breakdown

### Input

**Prompt:**
```text
Break down the "Task Management Dashboard" epic into user stories. 
The dashboard should allow users to:
- View all their assigned tasks in one place
- Filter and sort tasks by various criteria
- See task status at a glance
- Get insights into their productivity

Target users are individual contributors managing 10-50 tasks.
```

**Context:** TaskManager.Domain and TaskManager.Application code visible.

### Expected Output

**Format:**
- Epic description at top
- 6-10 user stories covering all stated functionality
- Stories organized by theme/feature
- Dependencies between stories identified
- Story estimates provided

**Content Expectations:**
- Stories cover: task list view, filtering, sorting, status visualization, productivity metrics
- Stories are progressively built (e.g., basic view before advanced features)
- Acceptance criteria include UI/UX details where relevant
- Performance criteria for large task lists (10-50 tasks)
- Mobile/responsive considerations may be mentioned

**Example Expected Stories:**
```markdown
## Epic: Task Management Dashboard

### Theme: Core View

#### Story 1: View Task List
**As a** user
**I want** to see all my assigned tasks in a single list
**So that** I have a central place to manage my work

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given I have assigned tasks, When I open the dashboard, 
      Then I see a list of all tasks assigned to me

      Then the list is paginated
- [ ] Given each task, When displayed, 
      Then I see title, due date, priority, and status

**Dependencies:** None
**Estimate:** 5 points
**Priority:** High

---

#### Story 2: Filter Tasks by Status
**As a** user
**I want** to filter tasks by status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
**So that** I can focus on active work

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given the task list, When I select a status filter, 
      Then only tasks with that status are displayed
- [ ] Given filtered results, When I clear the filter, 
      Then all tasks are displayed again
- [ ] Given multiple filters, When I apply them, 
      Then the count of visible tasks updates immediately

**Estimate:** 3 points
**Priority:** High
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Epic is properly introduced
- [ ] Stories cover all epic requirements
- [ ] Stories are logically ordered

## Scenario 3: Refinement with Constraints

### Input

**Prompt:**
```text
Generate user stories for adding task comments and collaboration features. 
Constraints:
- Must integrate with existing Task aggregate

- Real-time updates preferred but not required for MVP
- Target completion: 2-week sprint

Keep stories small enough to fit in the sprint.
```

**Context:**
- TaskManager.Domain/Tasks/Task.cs open
- Current Sprint capacity: ~20 story points

### Expected Output

**Format:**

- Total estimate ≤ 20 points
- Stories prioritized for MVP
- Real-time features marked as stretch goals or future stories
- Technical notes about integration with Task aggregate

**Content Expectations:**
- MVP stories: basic commenting, viewing comments
- Enhanced stories: @mentions, notifications
- Future/stretch: real-time updates
- Acceptance criteria consider existing domain model
- May reference specific domain patterns (DDD)

**Example Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Feature: Task Comments and Collaboration

**Sprint Capacity:** 20 points
**MVP Scope:** Basic commenting with @mentions

### Story 1: Add Comment to Task (MVP)
**As a** team member
**I want** to add comments to a task
**So that** I can provide updates or ask questions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given a task, When I add a comment with text, 
      Then the comment is saved and associated with the task
- [ ] Given a comment, When it's saved, 
      Then it includes author, timestamp, and text
- [ ] Given a task with comments, When I view the task, 
      Then I see all comments in chronological order

**Technical Notes:**
- Add Comment value object to Task aggregate
- Maintain aggregate boundaries per DDD
- Comments are part of Task aggregate, not separate entity

**Dependencies:** None
**Estimate:** 5 points
**Priority:** High (MVP)
