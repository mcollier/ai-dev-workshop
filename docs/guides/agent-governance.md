## Overview

### Purpose

Agent governance ensures that:
- Agents are high-quality and well-tested
- Changes are reviewed and documented
- The agent library remains maintainable
- Team members can trust agent outputs
- Deprecated agents are properly retired

### Scope

This governance applies to all files in `.github/agents/` and their associated documentation.

### Principles

1. **Quality over Quantity** - Better to have 3 excellent agents than 10 mediocre ones
2. **Test Before Merge** - All agents must be tested with real scenarios
3. **Documented Changes** - Every change requires rationale and examples
4. **Team Ownership** - Agents belong to the team, not individuals
5. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular review and refinement

---

## Agent Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Proposal

**Owner:** Anyone on the team

**Process:**
1. Identify a repeated, specialized task
2. Complete the [Agent Proposal Template](#agent-proposal-template)
3. Share with team for feedback (PR or discussion)
4. Get consensus on value and scope

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Team agrees agent would add value
- [ ] Scope is clear and focused
- [ ] No overlap with existing agents
- [ ] Success criteria defined

### Stage 2: Development

**Owner:** Proposer + Reviewer

**Process:**
1. Create agent definition in `.github/agents/[name].agent.md`
2. Create 3-5 test scenarios in `docs/requirements/agent-scenarios/`
3. Test agent against all scenarios
4. Iterate until success criteria met
<!-- 5. Document in [Custom Agent Catalog](./custom-agent-catalog.md) -->

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Agent definition complete
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] Example invocations documented
<!-- - [ ] Catalog updated with usage guide -->

### Stage 3: Review

**Owner:** Team reviewer (not the author)

**Process:**
1. Create PR with agent definition and documentation
2. Reviewer tests agent with scenarios
3. Reviewer validates output quality
4. Address feedback and iterate
5. Get approval from at least one team member

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Test scenarios validated by reviewer
- [ ] Documentation clear and complete
- [ ] No conflicts with existing agents

### Stage 4: Production

**Owner:** Team

**Process:**
1. Merge PR to main branch
2. Announce new agent to team (Slack, standup, etc.)
3. Monitor usage and feedback
4. Iterate based on real-world use

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Merged to main
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Catalog entry visible
- [ ] Agent appears in VS Code dropdown

### Stage 5: Maintenance

**Owner:** Team (agent champion optional)

**Process:**
1. Collect feedback from team usage
2. Track issues or improvement ideas
3. Periodic review (quarterly or as needed)
4. Update based on changing needs

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Feedback addressed
- [ ] Agent remains useful and accurate
- [ ] Documentation up-to-date

### Stage 6: Deprecation (if needed)

**Owner:** Team consensus

See [Deprecation Process](#deprecation-process) below.

## Change Management

### Types of Changes

#### 1. Minor Change (No Review Required)

**Examples:**
- Typo fixes
- Clarifying wording
- Adding examples
- Formatting improvements

**Process:**
1. Make change
2. Test with one scenario
3. Commit directly to main or quick PR

#### 2. Moderate Change (Review Required)

**Examples:**
- Adding new constraints
- Adjusting output format
- Expanding scope slightly
- Improving clarity significantly

**Process:**
1. Create PR with rationale
2. Test with all scenarios
3. Get one approval
4. Merge

#### 3. Major Change (Full Review Required)

**Examples:**
- Changing agent role or purpose
- Restructuring output significantly
- Modifying core instructions
- Breaking changes to format

**Process:**
1. Create PR with detailed rationale
2. Test with all scenarios
3. Get two approvals
4. Update all documentation
5. Announce to team
6. Merge

### Change Template

When making changes, include in PR description:

```markdown
## Change Type
[ ] Minor [ ] Moderate [ ] Major

## Rationale
Why is this change needed?

## Impact
What will change for users?

## Testing
- [ ] Tested with scenario 1: [result]
- [ ] Tested with scenario 2: [result]
- [ ] Tested with scenario 3: [result]

## Breaking Changes
[ ] None
[ ] Yes - [describe migration path]

## Documentation Updated
- [ ] Agent definition
- [ ] Custom Agent Catalog
- [ ] Test scenarios
- [ ] Related lab exercises
```

## Review Process

### Reviewer Checklist

When reviewing an agent change:

#### Functionality
- [ ] Agent performs stated purpose
- [ ] Output format is consistent
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable
- [ ] Scope is appropriately focused

#### Quality
- [ ] Instructions are clear and specific
- [ ] Examples provided where helpful
- [ ] Constraints defined (ALWAYS/NEVER)
- [ ] Tone is professional and constructive

#### Testing
- [ ] Tested with provided scenarios
- [ ] Outputs meet expectations
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] No hallucinations or inaccuracies

#### Documentation
- [ ] Catalog entry complete and accurate
- [ ] Example invocations provided
- [ ] Test scenarios included
- [ ] Related docs updated

#### Integration
- [ ] No conflicts with other agents
- [ ] Follows naming conventions
- [ ] Consistent with team standards
- [ ] Git history clean

### Review Timeline

- **Minor changes:** Review within 1 business day
- **Moderate changes:** Review within 2 business days
- **Major changes:** Review within 1 week

### Handling Disagreements

If reviewer and author disagree:
1. Discuss rationale in PR comments
2. Test both approaches if feasible
3. Bring to team discussion if unresolved
4. Team decision is final

---

## Versioning Strategy

### Version Tracking

Agents don't have explicit version numbers. Instead, we use:

1. **Git History** - Commit messages track changes
2. **Conventional Commits** - Structured commit format
3. **PR Descriptions** - Detailed rationale for changes
4. **Changelog** - Optional for major changes

### Commit Message Format

```text
<type>(agent): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New agent or major feature
- `fix` - Bug fix or correction
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `refactor` - Restructuring without behavior change
- `test` - Adding or updating scenarios
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```text
feat(agent): add migration-planner agent

Adds new agent for planning legacy code migrations.
Includes test scenarios and catalog documentation.

fix(architecture-reviewer): correct DDD pattern detection

Repository interface detection was too strict. Now allows
business-intent method names as documented.

docs(backlog-generator): add estimation examples

Added example invocations showing how to request story
point estimates in generated stories.
```

### Breaking Changes

If a change breaks existing usage:

1. Mark clearly in commit message:
   ```text
   feat(agent)!: restructure output format
   
   BREAKING CHANGE: Output format now uses sections instead
   of bullet lists. Update any automation that parses output.
   ```

2. Update documentation with migration guide
3. Announce to team with action required
4. Consider deprecation period if major impact

## Deprecation Process

### When to Deprecate

Consider deprecation when:
- Agent is rarely used (< 1x per month)
- Functionality merged into another agent
- Original need no longer exists
- Better alternative available
- Agent produces unreliable output

### Deprecation Steps

#### Step 1: Mark as Deprecated

Add to agent front matter:
```yaml
---
name: old-agent
description: [DEPRECATED] Use new-agent instead
deprecated: true
replacement: new-agent
---
```

Add notice to top of instructions:
```markdown
> **⚠️ DEPRECATED**  
> This agent is deprecated. Use [new-agent](./new-agent.agent.md) instead.  
> This agent will be removed on [date].
```

#### Step 2: Update Documentation

- Mark as deprecated in Catalog
- Explain migration path
- Reference replacement agent
- Set removal date (30-90 days)

#### Step 3: Announce Deprecation

- Notify team via Slack/email
- Explain rationale
- Provide migration guidance
- Answer questions

#### Step 4: Grace Period

- Monitor for any remaining usage
- Help users migrate
- Update any internal automation

#### Step 5: Remove

After grace period:
- Delete agent file
- Remove from catalog
- Update related documentation
- Commit with clear message

**Example commit:**
```text
chore(agent): remove deprecated old-agent

Agent deprecated on [date] and replaced by new-agent.
Grace period complete with no remaining usage.

See: [PR link to deprecation]
```
