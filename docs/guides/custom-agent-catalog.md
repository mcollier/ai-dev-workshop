# Custom Agent Catalog

This catalog provides a comprehensive reference for all custom GitHub Copilot agents available in this repository.

## Available Agents

### 1. Architecture Reviewer

**File:** [`.github/agents/architecture-reviewer.agent.md`](../../.github/agents/architecture-reviewer.agent.md)

**Purpose:** Reviews code for Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) compliance in .NET and Spring Boot applications.

**When to Use:**
- Before merging feature branches
- During architectural refactoring
- When adding new layers or components
- To validate dependency directions
- For educational feedback on architectural patterns

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes code structure against Clean Architecture layers
- Identifies dependency violations (e.g., Domain depending on Infrastructure)
- Reviews DDD patterns (aggregates, entities, value objects, repositories)
- Validates bounded contexts and domain modeling
- Provides actionable recommendations with examples
- **Supports both .NET and Spring Boot** - recognizes stack-specific patterns and violations

**Output Format:**
```markdown
# Architecture Review

## Summary
[High-level assessment]

## Layer Analysis
### Domain Layer
- ✅ Strengths
- ⚠️ Concerns

[... for each layer]

## Dependency Analysis
[Violations and recommendations]

## DDD Pattern Review
[Entity, value object, aggregate assessment]

## Recommendations
1. [Prioritized action items]
```

**Example Usage:**
1. Open relevant files (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)
2. Select "Architecture Reviewer" from agent dropdown
3. Example prompts:
   - .NET: "Review the Task aggregate in TaskManager.Domain for Clean Architecture compliance"
   - Spring Boot: "Review the taskmanager-domain module for DDD patterns and dependency violations"
4. Review structured feedback and prioritize recommendations

**Best Practices:**
- Provide context by opening related files
- Specify which component or feature to review

#### ⚠️ Warnings (Non-Blocking)  
#### ❌ Failures (Blocking)

**Recommendation:** [Approve | Fix failures | Address warnings]
```

**Example Usage:**
1. Open files to evaluate (service classes, domain entities)
2. Select "Quality Gate" from agent dropdown
3. Example prompts:
   - .NET: "Run quality gate on TaskService - check SOLID principles and code metrics"

- Recommends specific test scenarios with mock strategies
- Assesses test quality beyond raw percentages
- **Supports both .NET and Spring Boot** - understands different coverage tools and test frameworks

**Output Format:**
```markdown
### Test Coverage Analysis Report

**Overall Coverage:** X%
**Assessment:** [✅ Meets Standards | ⚠️ Below Target | ❌ Critical Gaps]

#### Coverage by Layer
[Domain/Application/Infrastructure/API with targets]

#### Critical Gaps
[Untested business logic with test scenarios]

#### Action Items
[Prioritized list of tests to add]
```

**Example Usage:**
1. Run tests and generate coverage report
2. Select "Test Coverage" from agent dropdown
3. Example prompts:
   - .NET: "Analyze coverage from coverage/coverage.cobertura.xml"
   - Spring Boot: "Analyze the test coverage - overall is 72%, identify gaps"
4. Review layer-by-layer analysis and prioritize test additions

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on business logic coverage first (Domain, Application)
- Use recommendations for specific test scenarios
- Balance coverage percentage with test quality
- Address critical gaps before merging
- Aim for 70%+ overall, 90%+ for Domain layer

---

### 4. Modernization

## Agent Invocation Examples

### Architecture Reviewer Examples

**Basic Review:**
```text
Review the TaskManager.Domain project for Clean Architecture compliance.
```

**Focused Review:**
```text
Analyze the Task aggregate in TaskManager.Domain/Tasks/ for DDD patterns 
and dependency management.
```

**Refactoring Guidance:**
```text
I want to move notification logic out of the Task entity. Review the current 
design and suggest where this belongs in Clean Architecture.
```

---

### Backlog Generator Examples

**From High-Level Requirement:**
```text
Generate user stories for a task manager where users can create, assign, 
and track tasks with due dates and priorities.
```

**Breaking Down Epic:**
```text
Break down the "Task Notifications" epic into user stories. Users should 
receive notifications for: task assignments, due dates, and status changes.
```

**Adding Details:**
```text
Enhance these user stories with detailed acceptance criteria:
[paste existing stories]
```

---

### Test Strategist Examples

**New Component:**
```text
Propose a test strategy for the Task aggregate in Domain layer. Include 
unit tests for business rules and integration tests for repository.
```

**Coverage Analysis:**
```text
Review test coverage for TaskManager.Application/Services/TaskService.cs 
and suggest missing test scenarios.
```

**Test Type Guidance:**
```text
Should I use unit tests or integration tests for validating task notifications? 
What scenarios should each cover?
```

## Agent Governance

All agents in this catalog follow our [Agent Governance](./agent-governance.md) process:

- **Versioning:** Changes tracked in git
- **Review:** All agent changes require PR review
- **Testing:** Agents tested with real scenarios before production
- **Documentation:** This catalog updated with each agent change
- **Deprecation:** Outdated agents marked and eventually removed

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use multiple agents in one conversation?**  
A: You can only have one agent active at a time, but you can invoke different agents in sequence. For parallel reviews, use separate conversations.

**Q: What if an agent gives incorrect advice?**  
A: Agents are tools to assist, not replace, human judgment. Always validate critical decisions. Report issues to improve agent definitions.

**Q: Can I modify agents for my needs?**  
A: Yes! Fork the agent definition, make changes, test thoroughly, and submit a PR if improvements benefit the team.

**Q: How do I know which agent to use?**  
A: See the "Agent Selection Guide" above, or refer to the decision trees in [Agent vs Instructions vs Prompts](../design/diagrams/agent-vs-instructions-vs-prompts.md).

**Q: Do agents work offline?**  
A: No, agents require GitHub Copilot service which runs in the cloud.
