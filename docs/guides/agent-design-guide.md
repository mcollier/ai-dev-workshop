## When to Create an Agent

### ✅ Good Candidates for Custom Agents

- **Repeated specialized tasks** that you perform weekly or more
- **Structured output requirements** (templates, formats, checklists)
- **Domain-specific analysis** requiring context and expertise
- **Role-based interactions** (architect, tester, product owner)
- **Multi-step workflows** with consistent patterns
- **Quality gates** and review processes

### ❌ Poor Candidates for Custom Agents

- **One-time tasks** or rare occurrences
- **Simple questions** answerable in standard chat
- **Highly variable tasks** with no consistent pattern
- **Tasks requiring human judgment** without clear criteria
- **General coding assistance** (use standard Copilot)

### Decision Criteria

Ask yourself:

1. **Frequency:** Will I use this at least weekly?
2. **Consistency:** Does it follow a repeatable pattern?
3. **Specialization:** Does it require specific expertise or perspective?
4. **Output:** Do I need a consistent, structured format?
5. **Value:** Will it save significant time or improve quality?

If you answered "yes" to 3 or more, consider creating an agent.

## Agent Design Process

### Step 1: Define the Problem

**Questions to answer:**
- What task does this agent perform?
- Who is the target user?
- What pain point does it solve?
- What does success look like?

**Example:**
```text
Problem: Developers spend 30+ minutes reviewing code for architectural 
compliance, and reviews are inconsistent.

Success: Agent provides consistent architectural review in 5 minutes, 
catching 80%+ of common violations.
```

### Step 2: Identify the Role

**Choose a clear persona:**
- Software Architect
- Product Owner
- QA Engineer
- Security Auditor
- Technical Writer
- Domain Expert

**Define the perspective:**
```text
Role: Expert Software Architect specializing in Clean Architecture 
and Domain-Driven Design

Perspective: Focus on dependency management, layer boundaries, 
and domain modeling patterns
```

### Step 3: Define Scope and Boundaries

**What the agent DOES:**
- Specific tasks it handles
- Types of analysis it performs
- Questions it answers

**What the agent DOES NOT do:**
- Out-of-scope tasks
- Handoffs to other agents or humans
- Limitations to manage expectations

**Example:**
```text
Scope:
✅ Review code against Clean Architecture principles
✅ Identify dependency violations
✅ Suggest DDD patterns

Out of Scope:
❌ Performance optimization
❌ Security analysis
❌ Implementation of changes
```

### Step 4: Design Output Format

**Choose structure:**
- Sections and headings
- Bullet points or numbered lists
- Code examples
- Priority/severity levels
- Action items

**Example structure:**
```markdown
# [Title]

## Summary
[High-level assessment]

## Analysis
### [Category 1]
- ✅ Strengths
- ⚠️ Concerns
- ❌ Violations

## Recommendations
1. [Priority 1 - Critical]
2. [Priority 2 - Important]
3. [Priority 3 - Nice to have]
```

### Step 5: Write Instructions

See [Writing Effective Instructions](#writing-effective-instructions) below.

### Step 6: Test with Real Scenarios

See [Testing and Iteration](#testing-and-iteration) below.

### Step 7: Document and Share

<!-- - Add to [Custom Agent Catalog](./custom-agent-catalog.md) -->
- Create example scenarios in `docs/requirements/agent-scenarios/`
- Share with team for feedback
- Submit PR following [Agent Governance](./agent-governance.md)

---

## Agent Anatomy

A custom agent consists of two parts: **Front Matter** (metadata) and **Markdown Body** (instructions).

### Front Matter Structure

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: One-sentence purpose of the agent
tools: ["read", "list_files", "search"]  # Optional
model: gpt-4o  # Optional, defaults to user's model
---
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Required | Description | Example |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- |
| `name` | Yes | Kebab-case identifier | `architecture-reviewer` |
| `description` | Yes | One-sentence summary | `Reviews code for Clean Architecture compliance` |
| `tools` | No | Tool permissions | `["read", "list_files"]` |
| `model` | No | Specific AI model | `gpt-4o` |

### Markdown Body Components

The body defines the agent's behavior through structured instructions:

#### 1. Identity and Role
```markdown
# Identity
You are an expert [role] specializing in [domain].
You have deep knowledge of [technologies/patterns].
```

#### 2. Responsibilities
```markdown
# Responsibilities
- Perform [specific task]
- Analyze [specific aspect]
- Provide [specific output]
- Identify [specific issues]
```

#### 3. Context
```markdown
# Context
This repository follows:
- Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)
- Domain-Driven Design patterns
- TDD with xUnit and FakeItEasy
```

#### 4. Constraints
```markdown
# Constraints

## ALWAYS
- Use specific examples from the codebase
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Reference specific files and line numbers

## NEVER
- Suggest changes outside your expertise
- Make assumptions about requirements
- Provide generic advice without context
```

#### 5. Analysis Process
```markdown
# Analysis Process
1. Review [aspect A]
2. Check for [specific pattern]
3. Identify [specific issues]
4. Validate [specific criteria]
5. Formulate recommendations
```

#### 6. Output Format
```markdown
# Output Format

Provide your analysis in this structure:

## Summary
[2-3 sentences]

## [Section 1]
- ✅ [Positive findings]
- ⚠️ [Concerns]
- ❌ [Violations]

## Recommendations
1. [Action item with rationale]
```

#### 7. Tone and Style (Optional)
```markdown
# Tone
- Professional and constructive
- Educational, not prescriptive
- Focus on "why" not just "what"
```

---

## Writing Effective Instructions

### Principles

#### 1. Be Specific, Not Generic

❌ **Bad:** "Review the code for issues"

✅ **Good:** "Review the code for Clean Architecture violations, specifically checking that Domain layer has no dependencies on Infrastructure or Application layers"

#### 2. Use Examples

❌ **Bad:** "Identify DDD patterns"

✅ **Good:**
```text
Identify DDD patterns such as:
- Aggregates with factory methods (e.g., Order.Create())
- Value objects with value equality (e.g., Address, Money)
- Strongly-typed IDs (e.g., OrderId, CustomerId)
- Repository interfaces with business-intent names
```

#### 3. Define Success Criteria

❌ **Bad:** "Check if code is good"

✅ **Good:**
```text
Code passes if:
✅ Domain layer has zero external dependencies
✅ All aggregates have private constructors
✅ Repository methods use business language, not CRUD
```

#### 4. Provide Structure

❌ **Bad:** "Tell me about the code"

✅ **Good:**
```text
Provide analysis in four sections:
1. Layer Analysis (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)
2. Dependency Violations (with file references)
3. DDD Pattern Review (Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects)
4. Prioritized Recommendations (Critical, Important, Nice-to-have)
```

#### 5. Use Constraints (ALWAYS/NEVER)

```markdown
## ALWAYS
- Include file paths and line numbers
- Explain the "why" behind each recommendation
- Categorize findings by severity

## NEVER
- Suggest changes without explaining the benefit
- Use jargon without defining it
- Provide recommendations outside architecture
```

#### 6. Make It Actionable

❌ **Bad:** "Code could be better"

✅ **Good:** "Move `NotificationService` from `Domain/Services/` to `Infrastructure/Services/` because it depends on external email APIs, violating Clean Architecture's dependency rule"

---

## Testing and Iteration

### Test-Driven Agent Development

1. **Create test scenarios BEFORE writing instructions**
2. **Define expected output for each scenario**
3. **Test agent against scenarios**
4. **Iterate until output matches expectations**

### Sample Test Scenario Template

```markdown
# Test Scenario: [Name]

## Input
[Description of code/context to analyze]

## Expected Output
[Specific format and content expected]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Output follows defined format
- [ ] Identifies all critical issues
- [ ] Provides actionable recommendations
- [ ] Tone is constructive and educational
```

### Testing Workflow

```text
1. Write 3-5 test scenarios
   ↓
2. Create initial agent definition
   ↓
3. Test scenario 1
   ↓
4. Review output → Issues found?
   ↓              ↓
   No            Yes → Refine instructions
   ↓                        ↓
5. Test scenario 2          ↑
   ↓                        |
6. Iterate through all ------+
   ↓
7. Production ready
```

### Iteration Checklist

After each test:

- [ ] Does output follow the specified format?
- [ ] Are findings accurate and relevant?
- [ ] Is tone appropriate?
- [ ] Are recommendations actionable?
- [ ] Are examples specific to the codebase?
- [ ] Is anything missing?
- [ ] Is anything extraneous?

### Common Refinements

| Issue | Solution |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Output too verbose | Add word/section limits to instructions |
| Missing context | Add more examples or constraints |
| Generic advice | Add "ALWAYS use specific file references" |
| Inconsistent format | Provide explicit template with placeholders |
| Wrong focus | Clarify scope and boundaries |
| Unhelpful tone | Add tone guidelines to instructions |

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Scope Creep

**Problem:** Agent tries to do too much

**Solution:** Define narrow, focused role
```text
❌ "Code Reviewer" (too broad)
✅ "Architecture Reviewer" (specific)
```

### 2. Vague Instructions

**Problem:** Agent provides generic output

**Solution:** Add specific examples and constraints
```text
❌ "Check for best practices"
✅ "Verify all aggregates use private constructors with 
   static factory methods (e.g., Order.Create())"
```

### 3. No Output Format

**Problem:** Inconsistent, hard-to-use output

**Solution:** Provide explicit template
```markdown
# Required Output Format

## Summary
[One paragraph]

## Findings
- ✅ [Finding]
- ⚠️ [Finding]
- ❌ [Finding]
```

### 4. Missing Context

**Problem:** Agent doesn't understand project conventions

**Solution:** Add context section
```markdown
# Context
This is a .NET 10 project using:
- Clean Architecture
- xUnit for testing
- Entity Framework Core
- Minimal APIs
```

### 5. Overly Prescriptive

**Problem:** Agent dictates instead of advises

**Solution:** Frame as recommendations
```text
❌ "You must change X to Y"
✅ "Consider moving X to Y because [rationale]. 
   This would improve [specific benefit]."
```

### 6. No Success Criteria

**Problem:** Can't measure agent effectiveness

**Solution:** Define measurable outcomes
```text
Success Metrics:
- Identifies 80%+ of architectural violations
- Provides 3-5 actionable recommendations
- Reduces review time from 30 min to 5 min
```

### 7. Assuming Too Much Knowledge

**Problem:** Agent uses unexplained jargon

**Solution:** Define terms or assume beginner audience
```markdown
## Tone
- Explain concepts, don't assume knowledge
- Define acronyms (e.g., "DDD (Domain-Driven Design)")
- Link to documentation when helpful
```
